## Multi-Label Classification of Amazon Forest Satellite Imagery

This project is dedicated to the development of a robust multi-label image classification system that leverages deep learning to categorize satellite images from a [Kaggle competition ](https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space) into various environmental and geographical labels. Utilizing a custom convolutional neural network architecture, the models are trained to recognize multiple features simultaneously, ranging from weather conditions and land types to human activities and natural phenomena. The ensemble learning approach further refines the performance, ensuring high precision and recall despite class imbalances. 

This repository contains the code, model training insights, and evaluation metrics for the classification system, highlighting the challenges and strategies of working with multi-dimensional label spaces in remote sensing data:
